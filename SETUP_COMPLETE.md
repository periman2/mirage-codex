# MirageCodex Setup Complete! 🎉

## What We've Built

Your MirageCodex project is now fully set up and ready for development! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ✅ Project Structure
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** component library
- **Vercel AI SDK** with support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models
- **Supabase** integration for auth, database, and storage

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

#### 🎨 Frontend Components
- **Homepage** with hero section and browse interface
- **BookGrid** - Beautiful book cards with generated gradient covers
- **BrowseFilters** - Language, genre, and tag filtering system
- **RandomizeButton** - Discover random books functionality
- **Responsive Layout** - Mobile-first design with glass morphism effects

#### 🗄️ Database Schema
- **Complete database migration** in `database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- **Reference tables** for languages, models, genres, and tags
- **User management** with profiles and billing
- **Search caching** with deterministic hashing
- **Content storage** for books, authors, and pages
- **Row-level security** policies for all tables

#### 🔧 Backend API
- **Search API** (`/api/search`) for cached book generation
- **AI generation utilities** with structured output using Zod
- **Hash-based caching** for consistent search results
- **Credit system** with BYO API key support

#### 🎭 AI-Powered Content
- **Multi-language support** (English, Greek, Spanish, French)
- **Genre system** with prompt engineering
- **Tag-based enhancement** for fine-tuned generation
- **Structured book generation** with titles, summaries, and outlines
- **Fictional author creation** with unique writing styles

### ✅ Configuration Files
- **.env.example** - Complete environment variable template
- **tailwind.config.ts** - Custom design system configuration
- **next.config.js** - Build optimization settings
- **README.md** - Comprehensive project documentation

### 🚀 Ready to Use

The project is now building successfully and the development server is running at:
**http://localhost:3000**

### 🔗 Database Setup

To complete the setup, you'll need to:

1. **Create a Supabase project** and get your credentials
2. **Run the migration** from `database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
3. **Update your `.env.local** with real credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase** and run the database migration
2. **Configure AI API keys** for content generation
3. **Test the search functionality** with real API calls
4. **Add authentication** flows for user registration/login
5. **Implement book reading** interface with page generation
6. **Add Stripe integration** for credit purchases

### 📚 Key Architecture Decisions

- **Deterministic caching**: Same search parameters always return identical results
- **Lazy page generation**: Book pages created on-demand to save costs
- **Multi-model support**: Users can choose different AI models
- **Credit-based billing**: Pay-per-page with BYO key option
- **Row-level security**: Database-level security for user data

## 🎭 The Vision Realized

MirageCodex is now ready to be "The Infinite AI-Generated Library of Hallucinatory Literature" - where users can explore an endless collection of fictional books, knowing they're all beautifully impossible AI creations.

**Browse Mode**: Free exploration of previously generated books
**Search Mode**: AI-powered generation of new fictional literature

Every book, every author, every story is entirely fictional and AI-generated, creating a truly unique literary experience.

**Happy coding!** Your infinite library awaits... ✨📚
